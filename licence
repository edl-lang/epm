Preamble
The EDL Public License (EPLv1) is designed to encourage open collaboration and innovation around the EDL programming language ecosystem, while protecting the rights of contributors and users. It provides a balanced copyleft framework tailored for system-level programming and tooling.

1. Definitions
“EDL Code” means any original or modified source code or related files written in or for the EDL programming language.

“Contributor” means any person or entity who creates or modifies EDL Code.

“Licensed Materials” means the original and modified EDL Code under this license.

“You” means the licensee who uses, modifies, or distributes the Licensed Materials.

2. Grant of Rights
You are granted a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to use, reproduce, modify, and distribute the Licensed Materials under the terms of this license.

3. Source Code Availability
If you distribute the Licensed Materials in executable or compiled form, you must make the corresponding source code available under this same license.

4. File-level Copyleft
Modifications to EDL Code must be released under EPLv1 on a file-by-file basis. You may combine EPLv1-licensed files with other files under different licenses in larger projects, but EPLv1 files remain under EPLv1.

5. Contribution Back
When you contribute changes back to the original EDL ecosystem repositories, you grant a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and distribute your contributions under EPLv1.

6. Trademark

7. Disclaimer of Warranty
Licensed Materials are provided “as-is” without warranties of any kind.

8. Limitation of Liability
In no event shall the contributors or the EDL Foundation be liable for any damages arising from the use of the Licensed Materials.

9. Termination
If you violate the terms of this license, your rights under this license automatically terminate.

10. Governing Law
This license is governed by the laws applicable to the EDL Foundation jurisdiction.

Summary:
